![Hypermod, the ultimate code-evolution toolchain](https://github.com/hypermod-io/.github/assets/3030010/5faa29df-27ae-473a-862b-664e705cd222)

Simplify the complexities of code evolution and migration by placing the transformative power of static analysis in the hands of every developer, empowering them to build, adapt, and innovate like never before.

#### WHY

Code evolution has become a never-ending endeavour, our industry devotes incredible amounts of time and energy to migrating between libraries and managing dependencies by hand rather than focusing on innovating key features. We believe static analysis tools are the key however, they are largely underutilized because the necessary infrastructure is missing for them to be viable at scale. 

#### HOW

Hypermod shifts the way developers handle codebase evolution by democratizing the power of static analysis. We turbocharge your development pipeline, enabling smooth migrations across various repositories and technologies, irrespective of their size and number. _All_ of your code evolves as a single entity.

With Hypermod, every developer gains the ability to harness static analysis to evolve code faster, smarter, and more effectively.

#### WHAT

- **Orchestrate Transitions:** Utilize tools that manage multistep code transformations across multiple repositories and technology stacks.
- **Live Metrics:** Gain insights into your code migrations, allowing you to make data-driven decisions.
- **Developer Empowerment:** Author and share custom transforms with your team or the wider developer community.

By giving you the tools to adapt and evolve, we aim to free your team from the bottlenecks of code management, letting you focus on what truly sets you apart.
